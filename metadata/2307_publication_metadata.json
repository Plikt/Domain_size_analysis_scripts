        "description": "Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are widely used to study the effects of surface morphology on turbulence statistics, exchange processes, and turbulence topology in urban canopies. However, as LES are only approximations of reality, special attention is needed for the computational model setup to ensure an accurate representation of the physical processes of interest. This paper shows that the choice of the numerical domain can significantly impact the accuracy of turbulent flow statistics, potentially causing a mismatch between numerical studies and experimental data. The study examines the influence of cross-stream aspect ratio (YAR), streamwise aspect ratio (XAR), and scale separation (SS) on first and second-order flow statistics and turbulence topology. It is found that domains with a low YAR underestimate the velocity variance, while those with a low XAR overestimate the variance value. The study proposes a new approach based on the Buckingham Pi theorem to evaluate the effect of SS, as the existing method has major limitations for canopy flows. The results suggest that domains with small SS underpredict the variance value. To minimize the artificial impact of the numerical domain on turbulent flow statistics, the study recommends guidelines for future research, including a YAR of 3 or more, an XAR of 6 or more, and an SS of 12 or more. Error tables are presented to allow researchers to select smaller domains than recommended, depending on their research interests in specific parts of the flow",
